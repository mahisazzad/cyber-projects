# Advanced Password Strength Checker

Welcome to Week 1 of my **#52Weeks52CyberProjects** challenge!  
This project is a Python-based password strength checker that evaluates password security using entropy, character diversity, and common password detection.

##  Features
-  Checks for uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters
-  Estimates entropy and rates password strength
-  Flags common passwords using a customizable wordlist (`common.txt`)
-  Provides actionable feedback to improve weak passwords

## 📊 Entropy-Based Strength Ratings
| Entropy Range | Strength      |
|---------------|---------------|
| < 28          | Very Weak     |
| 28–35         | Weak          |
| 36–59         | Moderate      |
| 60–79         | Strong        |
| ≥ 80          | Very Strong   |
