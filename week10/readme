# 🛡️ Minimal Malware Signature Scanner

A lightweight, YARA‑like malware signature scanner written in Python.  
This project demonstrates how to detect suspicious files using simple byte patterns and safe test strings.

---

## ✨ Features
- Define signatures directly in code (no external rule files needed).
- Detects:
  - Custom string patterns (e.g., `User-Agent: EvilBot`)
  - Safe demo signatures (e.g., `FAKE-EICAR-STRING`)
- Scans entire directories recursively.
- Prints clear match results.

## 📂 Project Structure
```
malware_scanner/
├─ scanner.py        # Main scanner script
└─ samples/          # Test files
   ├─ benign.txt
   ├─ suspicious.txt
   └─ fake_eicar.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone or download
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/malware-scanner.git
cd malware-scanner
```

### 2. Create sample files
```powershell
# Benign file
'hello world' | Out-File -Encoding ascii .\samples\benign.txt

# Suspicious file
'User-Agent: EvilBot' | Out-File -Encoding ascii .\samples\suspicious.txt

# Fake EICAR file (safe substitute)
'FAKE-EICAR-STRING' | Out-File -Encoding ascii .\samples\fake_eicar.txt
```

### 3. Run the scanner
```bash
python scanner.py
```

---

## ✅ Example Output
```
[MATCH] samples\suspicious.txt -> ['SuspiciousAgent']
[MATCH] samples\fake_eicar.txt -> ['Fake_EICAR_Test']
```

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- This project uses a **fake EICAR string** (`FAKE-EICAR-STRING`) to avoid antivirus interference.  
- Do **not** use real malware samples — this scanner is for **educational and demo purposes only**.  
- Extend it safely with regex, hex patterns, or entropy checks if you want more advanced detection.

---

## 📖 Next Steps
- Add regex support to detect URLs.
- Implement hex pattern matching with wildcards.
- Move signatures into external YAML/JSON rule files.
- Add CLI arguments (`--path`, `--json`) for flexibility.
