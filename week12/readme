## 🔎 Minimal Log Analyzer (Python)

A simple Python tool that reads system or web logs, counts error codes, and flags IPs with repeated failures. This project demonstrates how log parsing can be used to detect anomalies such as brute‑force attempts or misconfigured endpoints.

---

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Reads plain text log files line by line  
- 🔐 Detects repeated failures (status codes ≥ 400)  
- 📊 Summarizes error counts by status code  
- 🧠 Flags IPs with multiple failures  
- 🗂️ Works with sample Apache/Nginx‑style logs  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.10+**
- **Standard Library** (`collections`, `open`)
- **Sample log file** (`access.log`)

---

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/log-analyzer.git
   cd log-analyzer
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
   ```
3. Add a sample log file (`access.log`) with entries like:
   ```
   203.0.113.10 - - [27/Dec/2025:17:31:00] "POST /login" 401
   198.51.100.7  - - [27/Dec/2025:17:32:44] "GET /admin" 404
   ```
4. Run the analyzer:
   ```bash
   python log_analyzer.py
   ```

## 📊 Example Output
```
=== Status counts ===
401: 2
404: 1
500: 1

=== IPs with repeated failures ===
203.0.113.10: 2 failures
```

## 🧠 Why it matters
Log analysis is the backbone of incident detection. Even a minimal parser can highlight suspicious activity, repeated failures, or spikes in errors — the first step toward building SIEM‑like monitoring.
