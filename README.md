## 🔎 Overview
The projects span across:
- **Cryptography**: ciphers, hashing, password storage  
- **Network Security**: scanners, sniffers, vulnerability detection  
- **Web Security**: SQL injection, XSS, reconnaissance tools  
- **System Security**: file integrity, malware signatures, log analysis  

All projects are implemented with Python and other relevant technologies, focusing on hands-on security practices.

## 🚀 Projects

| Week | Project | Description / Goals |
|------|---------|---------------------|
| 1 | **Password Strength Checker** | Computes password entropy based on length, character variety, and dictionary checks. Future: add suggestions for stronger passwords. |
| 2 | **Caesar & Substitution Cipher Tool** | Implements basic encryption/decryption and brute-force breaking of classical ciphers. |
| 3 | **File Integrity Checker** | Hashes files in a directory and detects unauthorized modifications (mini-AIDE/Tripwire). |
| 4 | **Network Scanner / Port Scanner** | Uses sockets/Scapy to scan hosts and ports in a local network. |
| 5 | **Packet Sniffer** | Captures and logs network packets, parsing headers for traffic analysis. |
| 6 | **Keylogger (Local Sandbox)** | Records keyboard inputs locally for demonstration of monitoring techniques. |
| 7 | **Web Vulnerability Scanner** | Performs basic reconnaissance: open HTTP detection, default pages, directory enumeration. |
| 8 | **SQL Injection Demo & Mitigation** | Builds a vulnerable web app, demonstrates SQL injection, then applies secure coding fixes. |
| 9 | **XSS Demo & Protection** | Creates a web page vulnerable to cross-site scripting, then implements defenses. |
| 10 | **Malware Signature Scanner (YARA-like)** | Defines simple signatures to detect malicious files. |
| 11 | **Secure Password Storage** | Implements hashing + salted hashing in a user registration/login system. |
| 12 | **Log Analyzer / Parser** | Reads system/web logs, detects anomalies such as repeated login failures. |

## ⚙️ Setup & Usage
Clone the repository and navigate to any project folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mahisazzad/cyber-projects.git
cd cyber-projects/week-1-password-checker
python main.py
```

Each project folder contains its own scripts and documentation.

---

## 🔮 Future Work
- Expand scanners with advanced features (e.g., stealth scanning, banner grabbing).  
- Add visualization dashboards for log analysis and packet sniffing.  
- Dockerize vulnerable web apps for safe exploitation practice.  
- Implement unit tests for reliability across all projects.
